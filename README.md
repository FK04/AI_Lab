## ⚙️ How It Works
- Each folder focuses on a specific AI problem or search strategy  
- Problems are modeled as states with valid transitions  
- Search algorithms explore the state space to reach goal states  
- Heuristics are used in informed search to improve efficiency

## ▶️ How to Run
Ensure Python is installed, then run any script:
```bash
python filename.py
```

## For Jupyter notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
